Create the following gameobjects before applying a script
	- 3D object plain	
	- sphere
		-apply rigidbody on the sphere
	- point light
		- change the light position where you can see its light reflection on the sphere object

Machine Problem:

1. Create a script that enables the light to turn on and off when a space input key is triggered(press)
	- Note , Light component should be disabled once the script was applied.

2. Modify the code above, instead a user defined function is called in the update() to trigger the event.
